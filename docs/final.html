<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p style="line-height:200%">Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this project. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the project.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Section I: Rasterization</h2>

<h2 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h2>
 

<p>We rasterized our triangles in the following method:</p>
<ul>
    <li style="line-height:200%">We wrote a function to judge whether a point is inside the triangle.  We utilized the <b>Three Line Tests</b> method that was introduced in our class.</li>
    <li style="line-height:200%">We leveraged the given vertices to find the bounding box of the triangle and iterated all the points inside the bounding box. The sample positions are located at half-integer coordinates in screen space. Our algorithm is the same as the one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle.</li>
    <li style="line-height:200%">We then utilized the <b>fill pixel</b> function to fill in the pixels which are inside the triangle with their corresponding colors.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is our generated result figure 1 for your reference:</p>

<div align="middle">
  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/part1.png" align="middle" width="500px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle"><b>Figure 1. part 1 result</b></figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>


<h2 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h2>
<h4>Why is super sampling helpful?</h4>
<ul>
    <li style="line-height:200%">
        There might be aliasing happening when we directly do rasterization, it will cause jaggies or moire pattern which will
        decrease the quality of our rasterization. The aliases are created by insufficiently sampled high-frequency signals, two
        high-frequency signals are indistinguishable at a given sampling rate. Supersampling can help us filter out high-frequency
        signals by using a one pixel-box filter. This is the reason why super sampling is helpful.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Our modifications</h4>
<ul>
    <li style="line-height:200%">
        We leveraged a box filter inside one pixel and averaged the results as the pixel's final result. For every single pixels,
        we divided the pixels into n small boxes, the n is the given sampling rate. We divided our x and y to sqrt(n) to get
        the n boxes. Then we calculated the color information of these boxes. In this task, we judged it by whether the center of
        the box is inside the triangle. The we filled our sample_buffer. After filling sample_buffer, we just counted the
        average of every pixel to rgb_framebuffer_target and got our super sampling result.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Here is result on <b>basic/test4.svg</b> (Figure 2) for your reference:</p>

<div align="center">
    <table style="width=100%">
        <tr>
            <td>
                <img src="images/2_1.png" align="left" width="400px" />
                <figcaption align="center">1 sampling rate.</figcaption>
            </td>
            <td>
                <img src="images/2_4.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
                <figcaption align="center">4 sampling rate.</figcaption>
            </td>
            <td>
                <img src="images/2_16.png" align="right" width="400px" />
                <figcaption align="center">16 sampling rate.</figcaption>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <figcaption align="middle"><b>Figure 2. part 2 result with different sampling rates</b></figcaption>
</div>

<h4>Explanation:</h4>
<ul>
    <li style="line-height:200%">
        In this picture, their is a skinny triangle corner which means high frequency signals. So at the low sampling rate, the
        aliasing effect is very obvious, you can even observe the jaggies with out zooming in, and the edge is broken. But with
        the increasing of the sampling rate, the aliasing effect decreases and the edges become much more smooth and continuous.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 align="middle">Part 3: Transforms</h2>

<p style="line-height:200%">
    We made our cubeman model to do a very famous gesture in the last year's best game <b>Elden Ring</b>. The gesture name in
    the game is called "the gesture of elden ring". Here is a screenshot from the game and our generated result (Figure 3) for your reference:
</p>

<div align="center">
    <table style="width=100%">
        <tr>
            <td>
                <img src="images/elden_ring.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
            </td>
            <td>
                <img src="images/part3_new.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <figcaption align="middle"><b>Figure 3. game screenshot and our cubeman</b></figcaption>
</div>

<h4>What we did:</h4>
<ul>
    <li style="line-height:200%">
        In order to realize the "the gesture of elden ring", it is very easy to figure out that we first need to rotate our arms
        by a certain degree. In our experiment, first we changed our initial translation to help move our arms a little bit
        higher, then we rotated +- 60 degree after the initial translation. After rotating the arms,
        it is now time for us to rotate our short arms (hands). So we also rotated our hands by a certain degree and we changed
        the translation to help us connect our torsos together!
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>

<h4>Explaination of Barycentric coordinates:</h4>
<ul>
    <li style="line-height:200%">
        Suppose now we are going to do texture mapping and our meshes are triangle meshes
        . Now we have the color information on the vertices and we also want to know the color information inside each triangle
        mesh. Ideally we should have smoothly varying color across this surface and the color can be know from where the pixels
        locate inside this triangle. Barycentric coordinate can help us do that! It calcuates the weight of color information on
        the vertices and nicely interpolates the values among the surface! Here is figure 4 that can explain this:
    </li>
</ul>

<div align="center">
    <table style="width=100%">
        <tr>
            <td>
                <img src="images/part4_1.png" align="middle" width="500px" />
                <figcaption align="center"><b>Figure 4. Barycentric coordinate demo picture</b></figcaption>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

<p>
    You can easily notice that barycentric coordinates can help us get smooth color information inside the mesh! Here is the
    result of <b>svg/basic/test7.svg</b> (figure 5) for your reference:
</p>
<div align="center">
    <table style="width=100%">
        <tr>
            <td>
                <img src="images/part4_2.png" align="middle" width="500px" />
                <figcaption align="center"><b>Figure 5. result of svg/basic/test7.svg</b></figcaption>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>
<h2 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>

<h4>Explaination of Pixel sampling:</h4>
<ul>
    <li style="line-height:200%">
        Every pixels that we are going to do texture mapping have their corresponding locations on our texture map, for example
        (u, v). But the location may not be integer (texture sampling pattern not rectilinear or isotropic), so we need to
        find a method to get the color information by some interpolation methods. This can also be understood as a "texture
        magnification" strategy.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>How we implement it:</h4>
<ul>
    <li style="line-height:200%">
        For the nearest method, we directly use the <b>round()</b> function provided by C++ to help us to find the nearest sampling
        point in the texture map and for bilinear, we find 4 nearest points (4 pixels) around the sampling place and use *lerp*
        algorithm to get the final result.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>The difference between "nearest" and "bilinear":</h4>
<ul>
    <li style="line-height:200%">
        The "nearest" method just uses the information from one pixel on the texture map and "bilinear" method uses four. So the
        bilinear method will give us much more smooth sampling result than nearest method. But however, the computational time
        for the bilinear method is higher than nearest method.
    </li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height:200%">
    Here is the four results and the order is "nearest 1 sampling rate", "nearest 16 sampling rate", "bilinear 1 sampling rate",
    "bilinear 16 sampling rate" (figure 6):
</p>
<div align="center">
    <table style="width=100%">
        <tr>
            <td>
                <img src="images/n1.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
                <figcaption align="center">nearest 1 sampling rate</figcaption>
            </td>
            <td>
                <img src="images/b1.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
                <figcaption align="center">bilinear 1 sampling rate</figcaption>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <br />
        <tr>
            <td>
                <img src="images/n2.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
                <figcaption align="center">nearest 16 sampling rate</figcaption>
            </td>
            <td>
                <img src="images/b2.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
                <figcaption align="center">bilinear 16 sampling rate</figcaption>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <figcaption align="center"><b>Figure 6. pixel sampling result</b></figcaption>
</div>

<h4>Comment on the differences:</h4>
<ul>
    <li style="line-height:200%">
        It is very easy to figure out that the bilinear method outperforms nearest method in the selected area, no matter the sampling rate
        is 1 or 16. The nearest method will create uncontinuous sampling result on the longtitude line but bilinear method will provide 
        smoother result. That is because texture sampling pattern is stretched and produce high frequency signal on texture places. So
        using the nearest method will syntheszie jaggies. But after increasing sampling rate, both methods become better and bilinear method
        still creates better results.
